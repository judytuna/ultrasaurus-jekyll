```

## Deployment to GitHub Pages

### Option 1: GitHub Pages with Actions (Recommended)

1. **Create a new repository on GitHub**

2. **Push your code:**
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. **Enable GitHub Pages:**
   - Go to your repository settings
   - Scroll down to "Pages"
   - Under "Source", select "GitHub Actions"
   - GitHub will automatically detect Jekyll and set up the workflow

4. **Your site will be available at:**
   ```
   https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name/
   ```

### Option 2: Manual Build Process

If you prefer to build locally and push the built site:

1. **Build the site:**
   ```bash
   bundle exec jekyll build
   ```

2. **The built site will be in `_site/` directory**

3. **Deploy `_site/` contents to your hosting provider**
